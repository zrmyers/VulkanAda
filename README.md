# VulkanAda
An attempt at creating a binding to the Vulkan Library for the Ada Programming Language.

## Dependencies
This project depends on the following:
- GLFWAda, a lightweight binding of GLFW to use with Vulkan.
- AdaCore GNAT toolset
- Vulkan
- GLFW

On the Arch Linux operating system, the AdaCore GNAT toolset was obtained through the Arch User Repository (AUR), and GLFW and Vulkan were installed through the Arch Linux package manager.

The yum package manger for Arch Linux was used to install the Vulkan SDK and GLFW.

GLFWAda was obtained from another git repository.
